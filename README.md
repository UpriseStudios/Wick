# Wick

Mobile build-and-raid game: build trap vaults, raid other players' vaults as Wick,
a living candle thief. Unity 6 LTS, URP, portrait.

```

`Wick.Sim` is the one deterministic simulation shared by the client, Cloud Code
and tools. It is never copied: the .NET projects include
`unity/Assets/_Wick/Sim/**/*.cs` directly. Two compilers guard it:

- Unity: `noEngineReferences: true` on `Wick.Sim.asmdef`, so `using UnityEngine;`
  fails with CS0246.
- .NET: the server and tools projects have no Unity references and use
  `LangVersion 9.0` with implicit usings off, matching Unity's compiler, so code
  that builds there also builds in Unity.

## Setup

1. Install **Unity Hub** and Unity **6000.6.4f1** (the version in
   `unity/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`), with Android and iOS build support.
2. Install the **.NET 8 SDK** (`dotnet --list-sdks` should show 8.0.x).
3. Clone the repo, then in Unity Hub choose **Add > Add project from disk** and pick
   the `unity/` folder (not the repo root).
4. Open the project. The first import takes a few minutes.

## Running tests

Sim tests in .NET (fast, the same as CI):

```
dotnet test server/Wick.Sim.Server.Tests
```

Unity EditMode tests: in the Editor, use **Window > General > Test Runner > EditMode
> Run All**. From the command line:

```
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.6.4f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -projectPath unity -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults results.xml
```

Replay CLI (a placeholder that prints `ok` until M1):

```
dotnet run --project tools/replay-cli -- raid.json
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push and pull request:

- `sim-dotnet`: the .NET sim tests, plus a build and smoke run of replay-cli.
- `unity-editmode`: the Unity EditMode tests via GameCI. It needs the repo secrets
  `UNITY_LICENSE`, `UNITY_EMAIL` and `UNITY_PASSWORD`; see the GameCI activation
  guide (https://game.ci/docs/github/activation) to get or renew the licence file.
